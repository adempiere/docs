Maintain Project Reporting Cycles

The Project Cycle Window defines the steps associated with a specific Project.

Project cycles may use all or a subset of the used Project Status (e.g. Your opportunity project cycle may include the steps from prospect to contract - the service cycle may include steps from installation to customer acceptance.

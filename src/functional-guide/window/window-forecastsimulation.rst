Process to Calculate Forecast simulation

Help
====
The forecast simulation window, allows to define the required parameters to process a forecast calculation, these parameters are used for the forecast engine to extract the data from the sales historical, to execute the calculation algorithm based on the forecast rule and to save the forecast results.

Window Type
-----------
\ **Maintain**\

Forecast Simulation
-------------------
\ **Description**\ 
 \ *Create the forecast simulation based on the forecast definition*\ 
\ **Help**\ 
 \ *\ **Forecast Definition:**\ Establishes the forecast definition for this simulation.


\ **Forecast Rule: **\ Establishes the forecast rule to calculate this simulation.


\ **Operational Calendar: **\ Establishes the calendar to use, for the base periods definition and the target period definition.


\ **Source Warehouse:**\  Determines the warehouse for which the sales statistics information will be filtered, in this way it is possible to calculate a forecast for an specific warehouse.


\ **Base Period Definition: **\ Defines the basic periods to filter the sales history information.


\ **Target Periods Definition: **\ Defines the target periods, once the simulation process is executed the calculated values are organized in the order of the target periods definition.


\ **Periods Historical: **\ Determines the number of history periods, which must be used for the forecast calculation, the periods number are equivalent to the defined inputs at the operational calendar.


\ **Target Warehouse: **\ Determines the destiny warehouse with which the results are generated. In some enterprises the sales historical is generated for each point of sales, by this field is possible to change the source warehouse to a target warehouse with the goal of consolidate the demand in a target warehouse.


\ **Calculate Forecast: **\ This process allows to execute, by the forecast engine, the calculus algorithm established by the forecast rule, the forecast engine uses the established factors in the forecast definition. The calculated values for each period are saved as result of the simulation.*\

Client
------
\ **Description**\ 
 \ *Client/Tenant for this installation.*\ 
\ **Help**\ 
 \ *A Client is a company or a legal entity. You cannot share data between Clients. Tenant is a synonym for Client.*\ 

Organization

\ **Description**\ 
 \ *Organizational entity within client*\ 
\ **Help**\ 
 \ *An organization is a unit of your client or legal entity - examples are store, department. You can share data between organizations.*\ 

Document No
-----------
\ **Description**\ 
 \ *Document sequence number of the document*\ 
\ **Help**\ 
 \ *The document number is usually automatically generated by the system and determined by the document type of the document. If the document is not saved, the preliminary number is displayed in "<>".

If the document type of your document has no automatic document sequence defined, the field is empty if you create a new document. This is for documents which usually have an external number (like vendor invoice).  If you leave the field empty, the system will generate a document number for you. The document sequence used for this fallback number is defined in the "Maintain Sequence" window with the name "DocumentNo_<TableName>", where TableName is the actual name of the table (e.g. C_Order).*\ 

Description
-----------
\ **Description**\ 
 \ *Optional short description of the record*\

 \ *A description is limited to 255 characters.*\ 

Active
------
\ **Description**\ 
 \ *The record is active in the system*\ 
\ **Help**\ 
 \ *There are two methods of making records unavailable in the system: One is to delete the record, the other is to de-activate the record. A de-activated record is not available for selection, but available for reports.
There are two reasons for de-activating and not deleting records:
(1) The system requires the record for audit purposes.
(2) The record is referenced by other records. E.g., you cannot delete a Business Partner, if there are invoices for this partner record existing. You de-activate the Business Partner and prevent that this record is used for future entries.*\

-----------------------------
\ **Description**\ 
 \ *The records of this tab are generated as result of applying the combinations set in the forecast definition, each master record is a unique combination of product, warehouse, and the forecast factors used for this calculus.*\ 
\ **Help**\ 
 \ *\ **Alpha Factor: **\ This factor is used for the forecast engine and determines the smoothing constant used for some forecast models of exponential smoothing. It hast to be a value in the range of 0.0-1.0


\ **Gamma Factor:**\  This factor is used for the forecast engine and determines the smoothing constant used in second place for some forecast models of exponential smoothing forecast, the Gamma Factor is used to smooth the tendency, it must be a value in the range of 0.0-1.0


\ **Multiplied Factor: **\ This factor is used by the forecast engine and determines the percentage in which the calculated quantity of the forecast is increased or decreased. A negative percentage indicates the quantity is reduced.


\ **Scalar Factor:**\  This factor is used for the forecast engine and determines the percentage to be multiplied or scale a calculated quantity of the forecast, this value must be absolute.

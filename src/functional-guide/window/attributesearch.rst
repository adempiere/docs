Common Search Attribute 

Help
====
Attributes are specific to a Product Attribute Set (e.g. Size for T-Shirts: S,M,L). If you have multiple attributes and want to search under a common sttribute, you define a search sttribute. Example: have one Size search attribute combining the values of all different sizes (Size for Dress Shirt  XL,L,M,S,XS). The Attribute Search allows you to have all values available for selection.  This eases the maintenance of the individual product attribute.

Active

\ **Description**\ 
 \ *The record is active in the system*\ 
\ **Help**\ 
 \ *There are two methods of making records unavailable in the system: One is to delete the record, the other is to de-activate the record. A de-activated record is not available for selection, but available for reports.
There are two reasons for de-activating and not deleting records:
(1) The system requires the record for audit purposes.
(2) The record is referenced by other records. E.g., you cannot delete a Business Partner, if there are invoices for this partner record existing. You de-activate the Business Partner and prevent that this record is used for future entries.*\

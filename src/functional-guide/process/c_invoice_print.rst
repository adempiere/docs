Mail Template
-------------
\ **Description**\ 
 \ *Text templates for mailings*\ 
\ **Help**\ 
 \ *The Mail Template indicates the mail template for return messages. Mail text can include variables.  The priority of parsing is User/Contact, Business Partner and then the underlying business object (like Request, Dunning, Workflow object).
So, @Name@ would resolve into the User name (if user is defined defined), then Business Partner name (if business partner is defined) and then the Name of the business object if it has a Name.
For Multi-Lingual systems, the template is translated based on the Business Partner's language selection.*\

\ **Description**\ 
 \ *Identifies a Business Partner*\

Invoice
-------
\ **Description**\ 
 \ *Invoice Identifier*\ 
\ **Help**\ 
 \ *The Invoice Document.*\ 

Document No
-----------
\ **Description**\ 
 \ *Document sequence number of the document*\ 
\ **Help**\ 
 \ *The document number is usually automatically generated by the system and determined by the document type of the document. If the document is not saved, the preliminary number is displayed in "<>".

If the document type of your document has no automatic document sequence defined, the field is empty if you create a new document. This is for documents which usually have an external number (like vendor invoice).  If you leave the field empty, the system will generate a document number for you. The document sequence used for this fallback number is defined in the "Maintain Sequence" window with the name "DocumentNo_<TableName>", where TableName is the actual name of the table (e.g. C_Order).*\ 

.. note::
    The Range checkbox indicates that this parameter is a range of values.

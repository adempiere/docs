A configurable Bill of Material (CBOM) is used by industries that have multiple options and highly configurable products.

The CBOM is used to dynamically create "end-items" that a company sells. The benefit of using CBOM structure is it reduces the work-effort needed to maintain product structures. The configurable BOM is most frequently driven by "configurator" software, however it can be enabled manually (manual maintenance is infrequent because its unwieldy to manage the number of permutaions and combinations of possible configurations) The development of the CBOM is dependent on having a Modular BOM structure in place (see Modular BOM). The Modular BOM structure provides the assemblies/sub-systems that can be selected to "configure" an end-item.
